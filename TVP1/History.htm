		<h1>History of Food Blogging</h1>
            <p> With the rise of technology with the younger generation, people have been 
                becoming more clever with what they put out in the social media world. 
                Food has become a main attraction that can be a common thread for people all 
                around the world. With outlets like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, it is just
                a click away from showing everyone what you ate that day. There are food blogs
                in a website form, with fun recipes for families or how to keep fit with healthy 
                foods, or food instagrams where users post a delicious dish that they made 
                or ate at a popular restaurant. 
                Currently, half of surveyed customers learn about food through social media. 
                9% have downloaded a mobile food app in the last year
