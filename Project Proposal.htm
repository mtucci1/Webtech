        <h1> Project Proposal - McKenzie Tucci</h1>
        
        <h2> What is your website about? </h2>
            <p> My website is going to be about food blogging, the history of it becoming popular in our culture, which trends are being followed, and what blogs are most followed. 
             
        <h3> What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?) </h3>
            <p> This site would be important because it shows what is becoming more important with our culture, with people spending more time on the internet tracking their lives
                and it being something that people want to follow. 
                
        <h4> Who is your target audience set </h5>
            <p> My target audience is the new generation of younger social media users that are interested in sharing their ideas about food and how it relates to their everyday life.
                
        <h5> What content do you plan to include in each page of your website? </h5>
            <p> In each page of my website, I plan to include the history of blogs and how food blogging became so popular, what different styles and platforms the peopla are using,
                and what are the most popular trends being followed.
